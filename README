Simple ssh public key transfer on a token list
(You shouldn't probably use that on prod tbh)


the config file must be written like this:

login token
login token

in other words: login space token\n repeated as many as you like

because it was created for a pratictal on a given server, IP and Port
are hard coded (well port probably should be). The ip can be changed
in client.py:6. 

Maybe a more secured version will come, marbe not, don't expect much
